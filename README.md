# MultiThreadedWebSocketServer
A multi threaded websocket server written in C# that has been created to write simple games mostly serverside.
Currently only tested on windows.

## How to get started
This project has a .sln file which should contain all the information needed!

1. Clone project
2. Switch to the `develop` branch in git
3. Install / Update Nuget packages

After those steps everything should be set-up!

## Why was this project started
I originally started this project to learn about websockets and threading,
later idea shifted to creating a server that allows creation of a simple web game where most of the logic is handled by the server.
